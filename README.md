Welcome to my Github profile!
My name is Dawid and I am 2nd year Swansea University student (SE with a year in industry). 
I enjoy programming in java, and web developement. 
I am still learning java, and I aim to improve in database design as it is a crucial part of web developement. 
I am open to any computer-science-related collaborations that I can learn something valuable from.
