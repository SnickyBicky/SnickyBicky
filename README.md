Welcome to my Github profile! <br />
My name is Dawid, I am 2nd year Swansea University student (SE with a year in industry). <br />
I enjoy programming in java, and web developement. I am also trying to play around with various different langauges such as Python, VB and the almighty Assembly Language!<br />
I am still learning java, and I aim to improve in database design as it is a crucial part of web developement. <br />
I am open to any computer-science-related collaborations that I can learn something valuable from. <br />
